# How To Install WishSimulator.App to your <span> Android Phone</span>

## Why I need to Install it ?

You are not required to install it, the installed app is literally the same as the site, but I advise you to install it because it offers several advantages:

- **Simple to Access**, you don't need to open browser and type url address manually, access the simulator directly from your HomeScreen.
- **Offline Capability**, You can still open and run the simulator even if you don't have internet. But once the site has a new version, you have to connect it to the internet, the application will be updated automatically

## Steps

1. First, Open the site (**https://wishsimulator.app**) with **Google Chrome**.
2. Wait for the site to finish loading, **Click three dot** on the top rignt of the browser screen

6. Congratulations, Now you can access the Simulator directly from your Homescreen !
7. If You want to uninstall it, Just uninstall like a regular application. Press & Hold the app Icon, then select **Uninstall** option.
8. Alternative option, you can download and install the App from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=twa.wishsimulator.app" target="_blank"><img style="width: 7rem; transform: translateY(35%)" src="/images/utility/playstore-button.webp" alt="playstore button"/></a>. But you don't need to download it if you already install WishSimulator.App directly from web, because it's literally same!
