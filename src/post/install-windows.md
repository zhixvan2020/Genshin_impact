# How To Install WishSimulator.App to your <span> Windows</span>

## Why I need to Install it ?

You are not required to install it, the installed app is literally the same as the site, but I advise you to install it because it offers several advantages:

- **Simple to Access**, you don't need to open browser and type url address manually, access the simulator from your Desktop directly.
- **Offline Capability**, You can still open and run the simulator even if you don't have internet. But once the site has a new version, you have to connect it to the internet, the application will be updated automatically

## Requirement

- You must have a browser with a chromium base, for example **Google Chrome, Ms.Edge, Brave, Duckduckgo or others**. **Mozilla and Opera** can also be used too.

## Steps

1. First, Open the site (**https://wishsimulator.app**) with one of the browsers above.
2. Wait for the site to finish loading, then just navigate to the address bar, then click the install icon on the right side
